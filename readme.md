dotfiles and stuff

## dev to do

In the pursuit of command line only development

* try arch vps setup again with reboot after first pacman -Syu, see if it fixes docker (add note to reboot if it does)
* figure out solution for ctrl-space on ios being taken (likely will have to figure out a new tmux leader)
* config nnn for terminal only usage
* figure out a gist cli
* see if there are any better pagers / add line num info to less
* bind H and L in vim to zH and zL (or something better)
* make git work with vimdiff
* figure out vim diff viewer with fugitive
* vim debug for php
* see what http-prompt auto complete can do with openapi (and make script to auto generate for fitdegree)
