This repo has all the setup scripts and documentation I use to setup my mac after a clean install of macOS. The general order for setup is as follows.
1. Run mac.sh (read comments in file for more instruction)
2. Setup web dev environment ([webdev_setup.md](https://github.com/pricheal/dotfiles/blob/master/webdev_setup.md))
3. Setup fitDEGREE environment ([fitdegree_setup.md](https://github.com/pricheal/dotfiles/blob/master/fitdegree_setup.md))
